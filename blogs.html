      <h2>Question 2: Why is user interaction important in web development?</h2>
      <p>
        User interaction is crucial in web development because it directly impacts the user experience. An interactive website attracts users and fosters a stronger connection between them and the site. When users can express their opinions or utilize interactive features, they feel more engaged with the website. This engagement can lead to better customer satisfaction and ultimately positively influence business success.
